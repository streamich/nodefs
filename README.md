# Virtual File System for Node.js

Mount virtual files to your `fs` filesystem.

```javascript
var nodefs = require("nodefs");

var layer = {
    "test/index.js": "console.log('Hello World!')",
    "text.txt": "Hello again!"
    // ...
};

nodefs.mount("./", layer);
require("./test/index.js"); // Hello World!

var fs = require("fs");
console.log(fs.readFileSync("text.txt").toString()); // Hello again!
```

Why is it useful? It is used in `nodefs-drive` package to pack your Node.js projects into a single `.js` file.
When you run the file, `nodefs` creates the virtual file system and you app runs as if it was running from your hard drive.

# TODOs

 - Crate a light version with only `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.statSync`, and `fs.realpathSync`.
 - Implement the rest of the mehtods.
 - Crate a version with *read-only* file system.
 - Split project in multiple packages, lets say: (1) *in-memory* file system; (2) *read-only* file system; (3) etc..,
 and (4) a *union* file system that can combine then all together with `fs` module.
